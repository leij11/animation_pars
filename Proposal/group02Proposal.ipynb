    "Our task for this project is to take a step further with Jupyter Notebookâ€™s given functionalities by providing users with the ability to animate the execution of FSM. We will be implementing animations using the python library of pygame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let the user provide FSM as input, the program then draw the FSM diagram. Next, ask the user to provide input in the format of string, e.g.\"abc\". We put the given input into FSM and decide whether it fits FSM. If it fits, we execute the input in FSM and animate the execution of FSM by coloring the different components of the diagram.\n",

    "Furthermore, we could also provide the visualization of the algorithm for making FSM deterministic and equivalence."

    "Another ways of implementation could utilize turtle library or svg. In comparison, turtle have low implementation difficulty, but lack of code effiency. We might end up with thousands lines of code in order to finish our program. In another hand, svg animation have wide range of capability, but we are developed our project using Python, where svg is based on html and css. Since interfacing with different languages could be a difficult and unnessasary thing to do for this project, we decide to use Pygame library."
