Project Proposal: 1/3

A project proposal does not need to contain implementations, but needs to
discuss what is being animated in order to show what. The project proposal
should contain some illustrations instead. It should also discuss different
ways of implementations. It is unlikely that turtles are the best way. Overall
this is by far not ambitious enough to receive a passing grade. This topic
has already been taken by two other groups, so you need to modify it to give
it some distinction.

Project Artifacts:

Nice idea to use graphviz. Some comments about the poster: write "Problem *and*
Motivation", but use "&" or "and" consistently in headers. Space missing before
"Our project". Section "Documentation" doesn't say much, can be left out. The
second item under "Conclusion" doesn't say much, be specific or leave out. Since
you used graphviz, you may want to acknowledge that in the references.
