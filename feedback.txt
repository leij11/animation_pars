Project Proposal: 2/3

A project proposal does not need to contain implementations, but needs to
discuss what is being animated in order to show what. The project proposal
should contain some illustrations instead. It should also discuss different
ways of implementations. It is unlikely that turtles are the best way. Overall
this is by far not ambitious enough to receive a passing grade. This topic
has already been taken by two other groups, so you need to modify it to give
it some distinction.
